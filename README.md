## Summary
The purpose of this project was to create a digital system that served as an electronic scoreboard for a lawn tennis court at Ashesi's sports complex. Our team was tasked with designing the scoreboard to display scores in the traditional lawn tennis form which progesses from ""Love/lo"(0) to 15 then to 30 then finally to 40. The tennis score board was made using knowledge in digital system design with the aid of VHDL via Vivado and Logism circuits.
